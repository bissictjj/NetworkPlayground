# NetworkPlayground
Simple Network App (just playing around with different networking capabilities)
#UPDATE: Kind of became a playground for more than just network stuff! Have a look :)
So far we have:

-> WiFi P2P /w Service Discovery

-> P2P Peer Discovery /w Music Transfer

-> GoogleMaps /w User Location Discovery (#TO DO: working out distance from point to point)

-> Video and Photo Capabilities (#TO DO: editing of both media)

-> Search Functionality for Contacts
